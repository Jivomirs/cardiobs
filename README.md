This is the repository for the development of the cardio-bs website made with SvelteKit, SASS with Netlify adapter. This website is written in modular artchitecture (there are importable components which may take props; stores; etc.) You can read further about how this website works in this and additional READMEs.

If you want to contribute to development and upgrading this website or develop it yourself (this usually refers to developers who have already in touch with us) make sure to read this documentation.

## 🖊️ Ways to contribute

There are several ways you can help if you've found a bug, design flaw, documentation typo or you want a feature added. Any contributions made with the below-mentioned methods is of great help! Thank you so much if you are taking the time to help!

- Fork this project and submit a pull request
- Open an Issue (make sure to label it appropriately)
- Email teampraxidike@protonmail.com

### *Which option should I choose?*

If you are experienced in **SvelteKit/Svelte**, **CSS** and **HTML** and you have to time to fix an issue by yourself (or with someone else) forking this project is the most helpful option.

If you don't have the time or don't think you can fix this problem by yourself AND have an account on GitHub you can open an issue (from the Issues tab above). This way you can still help a lot by pointing out documentation/design/general bugs, errors or mistakes.

Finally, you can email teampraxidike@protonmail.com with the issue (least preferred method)
